When a .java has a J  hollow and doest not appear any colours in the file is because eclipse does not recognize the  project has a Java project.

This can happen even for a maven project.

**Caused by**

This is caused by the .settings folder of the project is missing or misses files. Therefore eclipse does not know what kind of a project it is.


**Solution**

Copy the .settings folder of one similar project that is working to the one that is not being recognized.
